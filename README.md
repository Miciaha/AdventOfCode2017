# :gift::star::christmas_tree: Advent Of Code 2017 :christmas_tree: :star: :gift:
"*Advent of Code* is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme." - *Eric Wastl*

I like programming puzzles... figured why not! Starting a little late (12/11/17), but better than never. :smile:
